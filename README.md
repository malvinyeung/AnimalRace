AnimalRace

In this race I used the Math.random to output a random number. I multiplied that by 100 and ronded it to the nearest whole number to give me the percentage of the animals focus level. Using that focus level I can then determine the winner by multiplying the speed by the percentage. The higher number wins the race because the focus level times the speed equals the deciding factor of the race. By putting the entire code into a function,, not only gives me re-usability but also the ability to repeat the function if the user wishes to repeat the race again. It also allows the focus level to reset and give a different number everytime the function repeats.

I had a mistake that didnt allow the program to run, then I realized that I made the function but I didnt globally call the function properly. I was typing "gameStart;" instead of "gameStart();". The parenthases shows that it is a function with an argument.
